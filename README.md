## Project Description
  Lately, corporations encounter problems with scheduling meeting and other activities in their available conference rooms. This thing happens due to the lack of a platform dedicated to the planification of meetings in these rooms. This project comes & helps the employer and employees to schedule a meeting in a room, on the spot, and see which rooms are busy. Also, you can subscribe to follow a room and be notified once the room becomes free.
